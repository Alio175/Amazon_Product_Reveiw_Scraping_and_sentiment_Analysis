m mullins love love love best phone i ve ever had came from an a series phone reviewed in the united states on august 17 2022 color graphitesize 128gbstyle s21 fepattern name cell phoneverified purchase my last phone was a samsung a10e and anyone coming from a cheap a series phone can for sure tell you that this is a major upgrade i got the 128gb s21 fe model and i only paid 590 usd for the black version despite really really wanting the white version yet that one was priced at 699 usd would i pay 699 for it probably not but everyone has a different budget for everything when i received the phone it came in its regular factory box which is very thin like i was concerned for a second that they just sent me a case but nope they ve cut down on everything that they send you it came with the phone a manual in a tiny box a sim card tool behind that box and i believe short type c cable i already have a charging cable so i didn t pay any attention to it not that big of a deal really it just worried me for a second haha now i m someone who worries about storage and this phone does not come with a micro sd card slot unlike the s20 fe however i ve not had any problems with my storage yet i still have roughly 61gb out of the 128gb to go the system itself is 22 5gb which is expected as this is a very beefy and fast machine and then i play a lot of games so my apps take around 39gb i don t take many photos either so i only have around 1gb used but if you are someone who loves to take photos i recommend getting a separate portable hard drive or even using your personal computer to send your photos over as spending 70 130 for just 128gb of more storage is a lot when you could use that to get around 500gb on a standalone drive it is also worth mentioning that getting the bigger storage version for this phone also adds 2gb of ram to it giving it a speed boost but i m about to go over some things about the phone s speed as for game wise i play genshin impact colorful stage project sekai stardew valley pokemon go and fallout shelter and this thing runs them all like a beast i wouldn t recommend getting the extra 2gb of ram in the bigger storage model since this phone can run pretty much anything you throw at it anyone who s ever played genshin impact knows how heavy the game is and it can run it at max settings just fine the only problem is that it gets incredibly hot so hot that it lowkey hurts to touch after playing for more than just 5 15 minutes this could be completely fixed if you get a cooling mount for around 20 30 i do prioritize game functionality and speed over looks so i do play extremely comfortably in low medium settings as it still looks great however if you re looking for a gaming machine with smooth fps and no lag at all with maximum settings on heavy games since bigger temperatures means lowering the processing of your game causing lag i ll have to recommend looking for a different phone such as an iphone or a oneplus since they do that well the camera is good for me i take photos of my dog and that s it it also has a 30x zoom which is crazy the front camera is really good and i sometimes put it up to my head and angle it to make myself look like a goldfish and it s super funny haha the fingerprint reader works extremely well even with a screen protector fun fact i found you can lay your finger over your fingerprint reader while the screen is off and it ll unlock so you don t even have to double tap your screen to wake it up or press a power button i was never a fan of 120hz screens and i still am not but it looks super smooth when i have it turned on the amoled screen was a huge game changer for me it s beautiful and has incredible contrasting colors i know people say they have tons of issues with the battery to this device but i honestly haven t had any problems whatsoever now i do keep medium power saving mode on as i just don t see too much to the use of allowing your phone to do any big background services when you re not using it it lasts about a day and a half i work 9 5 and i come home with 70 battery after being on it or checking it very often and frequently now i will say there has been some connectivity issues during heavy storms and heavy storms only but i experienced that issue with my last phone so there s a massive chance that s just my mobile data provider which is us cellular by the way this phone is unlocked so it should be able to accept just about any other provider you use i also think it supports 2 sim cards i m not too sure as i m not someone who would ever have to use it but if you are then that s a plus overall this phone is absolutely amazing and i 11 10 recommend it 129 people found this helpful helpful report,0.039,0.787,0.174,0.9992
shawn great phone marred by some pretty big issues reviewed in the united states on november 18 2020 color cloud navysize 128gbstyle s20 fepattern name cell phoneverified purchase i decided on the samsung galaxy s20 fe for my smartphone upgrade for a lot of reasons one and most obviously was the price at 599 the price on amazon when i purchased it it was an unbeatable deal another was the specs snapdragon 865 and 6gb of ram was perfect for my needs my old galaxy s7 looked practically primitive when set against the s20 fe and so i decided to give a midrange phone a try at first glance the s20 fe seemed too good to be true the screen while not 4k still looks great with the 120hz refresh rate enabled the rear cameras look incredibly good nice and crisp i ve done everything from web browsing and gaming to word processing and photography all with minimal issue battery life is solid but not the best in the market right now you ll still be able to get a couple of days out of the s20 fe on 120hz also you can t beat the customizability of android with the option to install launchers widgets plus a wealth of storage and sd card support you get a lot of choice with the s20 fe the size while much larger than i was used to still fits in the hand really well i would recommend getting a case and screen protector for this one though as i have seen people shatter the screen with a single drop but if you ve been reading up on the s20 fe at all then you know that there are problems first off the virtual proximity sensor on the phone is spotty at best testing it out myself i had to be right on top of the sensor for it to detect my face and for phone calls that means a few more accidental muted ended calls than usual the face recognition and fingerprint scanner are also not great i d say it works about 85 of the time but when it doesn t do you ever feel it adding on the front facing camera is pretty lackluster not bad but it s not flagship levels by any stretch you ll need to be in absolutely optimal lighting to get a decent picture out of it so if you re looking for a phone to take selfies indoors with i d look elsewhere from what i ve seen the standout complaint with the s20 fe is the touchscreen and yes my phone ordered in early november has the issue too pretty horrendous ghosting when testing it in the touchscreen test app there s undeniably a hardware issue with the s20 fe there have been updates since the phone released but none have fixed it entirely merely a band aid on a bloody gash the real question is does it affect everyday use will you notice it every moment you use the s20 fe the answer to both is no at least for me while i m sure it does affect certain tasks most notably those that involve fast touches or 3 fingers i really haven t noticed it in actual use pinching zooming with your fingers close together will cause the screen to jitter but that s about all i ve seen if that worries you enough to pass on the s20 fe i don t blame you it really is a shame that i can t give the s20 fe a perfect 5 stars because it does deserve it in some aspects but with these hardware issues there s always the worry that time will make them worse it s a genuine worry i get that but even with the problems the samsung galaxy s20 fe is a pretty great phone it really does feel like a flagship phone but with a massive price cut and a few downgrades only time will tell if the problems the phone has will get worse but for right now i m more than happy with it edit 8 18 2021 i ve dropped my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars it s been a little less than a year and the issues mentioned above have started to affect daily use in a way that turns this from a great phone to an okay phone not worth your time okay maybe not daily use per se but enough that it s starting to effect my initial thoughts on it the amount of times this phone has turned on in my pocket because of ghost touches is insane every time i take it out of my pocket it s opened a random app and input a few letters on the keyboard and this is after adjusting the settings to stop these sorts of things i turned off double tap to turn on despite wanting that feature and turned on accidental touch protection which did absolutely nothing i even made it so that the phone needed face recognition or a fingerprint to unlock every time i close it but it just keeps happening no software update really fixed the screen as suspected this is a pure hardware messup here s the cold honest truth the screen on the s20 fe is terrible worse than my old s7 worse than even a budget android phone s screen it s beyond comprehension the virtual proximity sensor is also worthless i almost want to give it the classic angry amazon customer 1 star review but i ll refrain there s still good here with the chip customizability and great battery life but that stuff can only get you so far here s my advice don t bother with this phone you can get a midrange smartphone for the same or even a lower price with better specs it s still not the worst thing out there and i m not tossing it in the trash just yet but it s definitely the last samsung product i ll be buying so disappointing but i couldn t keep this review a 4 star in good conscience 645 people found this helpful helpful report,0.108,0.758,0.134,0.9838
ken edited s21fe an okay phone stick with an all tpu case reviewed in the united states on july 28 2022 color cloud navysize 128gbstyle s20 fepattern name cell phoneverified purchase last update 12 24 22 this will be my last update as i traded this in for a google pixel 7 with the price that i bought it at and the amount for trade in i received from google on their black friday sale i couldn t pass it up and was basically a wash this phone never received a monthly security patch i don t know if that is a samsung amazon or t mobile issue and maybe it is because i had bought the 256gb storage option but it is a major one to me i don t know if this phone would have even received one ui 5 aka android 13 and i traded it in before i heard it was released in the us for this model in my few months with this phone the best thing about it was the price both amazon s sales price and google s trade in value take that for what you will if you have a use case similar to mine update 9 15 22 i have not received any security updates august should have been out by now september was just released but my phone is still on the july patch the phone shipped with i am not sure why this is and unlike a pixel phone there is no way to force sideload a security patch in the same timeframe my s20fe did receive the august patch i am holding off for now and hoping this is a fluke but if i don t receive the september update by october this may indicate an issue with phone itself update 8 9 22 after going caseless for a couple of days both on wifi almost exclusively one day and on 4g lte another the case was likely the issue both tests resulted in a warm not heated phone after heavy usage and over 6 hours of screen on time the spigen thin hybrid was the same case i had for my s20fe except this one was not the clear option i am not sure if the hard type of plastic on the back did not displace heat well with this phone model or if something in the non clear cases are made with a material that interferes with rf signals but that case was returned and a cheap all tpu case was purchased screen on time has continued to improve from the barely 5 hours before to 6 5 7 with the same usage now as such i have added one star to my review i still encounter ghost touches and i am not sure how much of an improvement the case change has been to signal strength but this has gone from an underwhelming experience to a solid option for those that can get a good deal on it original review below i have bought and used both an s20 fe 6 ram 128 rom in 2021 and an s21 fe 8 ram 256 rom on prime day in 2022 while the s20 fe ended up being almost the perfect phone for the past year the s21 fe was not worth it even at amazon s great price s21 fe pros 1 slightly smaller than the s20 fe and i found it easier to handle a few millimeters makes a huge difference here 2 camera was excellent as every other samsung phone i have owned has been 3 phone had the july 5th android update waiting to download when i received the phone in mid july my s20 fe was about a month behind on monthly patches probably due to samsung prioritizing newer phones 4 solid construction like the s20 fe i have no worries of this getting bent punctured or damaged from compression as i have experienced on some phones as with just about every other phone i have owned i have a tpu case on it to prevent fall damage s21 fe cons 1 battery life a little about my settings after doing all updates i factory reset the phone to have a clean install downloaded all apps and then turned auto brightness and nfc off only have bluetooth on when in the car screen set to 60hz refresh 5g off and mostly on fiber connected wifi at home on my s20 fe this could get me 9 hours on screen time for one charge easily the same settings on the s21 fe barely eek out 5 hours with a slightly smaller screen and the same battery size not sure if this is a bad android security update which will prompt an addendum to this review next month or the phone itself but underwhelming after 2 weeks of usage 2 possibly tied to the battery it seems a lot warmer than my s20 fe ever got when using for long periods of time will be using without a case at home to see if that is part of the issue or not 3 connectivity i wouldn t say there are rampant issues per se but it does not seem to have the signal strength when using 4g lte when out and about again the case may be a factor here and will be using without for a couple days 4 ghost touches have had odd things happen with active on display stopping music or tapping one area of the screen to open an app and something else entirely launches at this point this was not worth the upgrade for my use case and i probably should have just bought another s20 fe instead my phones get full usage daily and it is just a matter of time before the s20 fe s battery starts to take a hit however with the charge i get out of the s21 fe i probably could have stuck with my current s20 fe for quite some time 60 people found this helpful helpful report,0.07,0.831,0.099,0.9879
a i one of the best deals today we got three of them in our family over the past year reviewed in the united states on may 23 2022 verified purchase i believe it is one of the best deals available for a new established brand name android phone my son got one of these first i got one for myself half a year later and recently we got one for my wife the reasons which we like this phone are as follows 1 it still accepts sd cards newer samsung phones do not you can add 256 gb of flash memory for pictures and video for 30 the same upgrade of memory with the latest samsung phone models would cost you about 200 they charge at least 100 per 128 gb of built in flash a street robbery if you need more memory you can plug in sd card with capacity up to 1 tb you can store huge number of movies on it 2 it comes with a charger an extra charger never hurts this is a slow 15 w charger but it does its job charges the phone over about 2 3 hours i usually leave it plugged in overnight 3 this phone has a very good for a smart phone battery life with active use through the day the battery comfortably lasts through the day if the phone used only for phone calls and occasional e mail checks the battery will last for two days or longer 4 cameras work quite well resolution is good image quality is good the phone has three camers with different focal length plus front side camera perfectly sufficient for all reasonable uses 5 the screen is big but not excessively huge the phone is just right size to fit into the hand comfortably 6 we use it on att prepaid plan it is fully compatible with att wireless and is fully supported 7 it is nominally 5g but this in reality translates into more dram and a little better camera and nothing more there is no true 5g in the u s thankfully i do not want to carry a microwave source next to my body if you go to att web page you will learn that there are three flavors of 5g the first two of them are nothing but marketing tricks at t 5g using low band spectrum reaches more than 277 million people in more than 18 000 cities and towns in the u s this is slightly upgraded 4g lte there is nothing 5g in it this is what you get from all major carriers sold to you as 5g it is just a little bit faster than regular 4g at t 5g using recently introduced c band spectrum sits between our other two bands and provides a great combination of ultra fast speeds and wide geographic coverage this has very little availability and it is still not true 5g yet at t 5g using millimeter wave spectrum delivers super fast speeds and unprecedented performances in high traffic areas including parts of more than 40 cities and more than 40 stadiums and venues availability of this is extremely limited in very limited selection of places pretty much nowhere 8 all three s20 fe phones in our family so far have been working very well they are solid reliable and well made the downsides are few one i am missing a headphone jack i have a couple of boise noise cancelling headphones no bt which i would like to be able to connect with this phone i need a usb c to headphone jack adapter to accomplish it 10 15 is not a big deal but it is very easy to lose second downside this phone still has that useless annoying bixby but it got less annoying compared to my old phone finally there are very few pre installed apps and very little work is needed to clean them up i do not play games on the phone so i cannot judge if it is good for gaming probably for latest games one needs the newest fastest phone for youtube or movies stored on the phone it works perfectly well the screen has good resolution and is silky smooth at 120 hz i am convinced it is a great phone to get in the android family as long as it is available 43 people found this helpful helpful report,0.054,0.758,0.188,0.9989

star vine voice i love it reviewed in the united states on december 2 2022 color olivesize 128gbstyle s21 fepattern name cell phoneverified purchase i didn t think i d ever be able to afford a new galaxy s series and if my old galaxy a 51 hadn t died i wouldn t have spent the money to buy a new phone but it completely died after 2 1 2 years and could not be repaired so i had to however at a 399 00 cyber monday special i was able to get this 1 model back s 21 for what i d have spent on a comparable a series and two major things the s series features that the a doesn t is that it supports wireless charging and smart watch connectivity it also has a much better camera and i m sure i ll find other great features as i go along the color isn t as ugly as i was afraid it would be you can actually put a tinted clear case on it and make it a little more pretty or completely cover it with a solid case it doesn t come with any extras like galaxies used to in the past like a manual a case a wall plug a car plug or screen protecter nothing except a shortish cord and a tool to pop out the sim card slot which is on the side my service carrier is a government lifeline company which runs on the t mobile network so i just put my old sim card in my new phone and it was connected instantly with the same phone number provider but i did have to go through all the google setup which would have been way easier if my old phone had not been dead but i got all of my contacts back though without their photos i d put with their names and i lost all the photos from my dead phone i got most of my apps back but i did have to reinstall a few and log into most again in order to use them galaxies stopped making the body casings openable a few years ago so batteries can t be replaced easily and to try to get them repaired a tech has to melt the sides of the case open which turned out really ugly when i tried to get my a 51 s charging port replaced which didn t save my old phone anyway and it looked like smeared crap after they melted it back together fyi this is a very desirable phone despite the new attempts to make it more throwaway hopefully it will last me at least 3 or 4 years that would be 100 a year plus interest it s sad how much things cost so much today 29 people found this helpful helpful report,0.058,0.76,0.182,0.9961

l2 very good phone for the price samsung bloatware is easier to deal with than in past years reviewed in the united states on october 29 2020 color cloud navysize 128gbstyle s20 fepattern name cell phoneverified purchase now that the price on this phone has gone down to 600 it is a very good deal for the price the snapdragon 865 processor is more than fast enough for anything i want to do 6gb of memory is less than some other phones in this price range but it is still more than enough for most people the phone feels very solid despite the plastic back if you use any kind of case you won t even notice the plastic back the phone supports 25w fast charging but for some reason they only included a 15w charger in the box buying the 25w charger separately is a waste of money as well as a waste of the natural resources that were used on the 15w charger amazon sells decent 25w fast chargers for less than 15 so cheaping out on the charger is a real lame move by samsung you can search amazon for 15w chargers that support usb c pps mode and are ul certified the screen looks beautiful when you turn on the 120hz mode this does burn your battery more quickly but the battery is big enough that it still lasts all day the screen has been very responsive to me i have read bug reports about screen glitches for some people samsung has already released bug fixes that hopefully have fixed this i advise only buying this phone from an authorized dealer with no hassle returns so you don t have to worry about this bug the phone does have a lot of samsung bloatware i owned a samsung s series phone several years ago and the bloatware was really bad then this one is much better you don t even need to create a samsung account to use the phone now most of the samsung bloatware other than the camera app won t work if you don t have a samsung account but if you never use it this isn t a problem there are several tutorials online about disabling all the bloatware if you never want to see any of it on your screen the triple camera setup on this phone is very good for this price level the telephone camera works great up to 3x in good light image quality deteriorates quickly if you zoom in past 3x or in lower lighting conditions telephoto cameras are getting rare in this smartphone price range so i m glad this phone has one i really like using the telephoto lens for landscape and nature photography the normal and wide angle cameras work better in lower light situations including indoor situations though not as good as the iphone or google pixel phones pictures do tend look more processed than with some other phone cameras some people like the samsung look other people prefer more natural looking photos you should try to look at sample photos before buying the phone since you cannot completely disable the samsung photo processing this phone comes with android version 10 out of the box which is one version behind the android version 11 that the google pixel phones are shipping with samsung promises software support with 3 version updates but that is a little misleading since 1 of those version updates will be just to catch up with the current android version 11 still 3 years of bug fixes and security patches is better than what samsung used to offer 42 people found this helpful helpful report,0.056,0.772,0.171,0.9977
